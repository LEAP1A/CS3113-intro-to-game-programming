<h1 align=center>Exercise: <em>Transformations</em></h1>

### Instructions

In this exercise, we will implement transformations on an object; in this case a simple triangle is enough. Our goal is to make our triangle move in the following orbital movement:

<sub>**Figure 1**: Your goal.</sub>

You can find the starter code [**here**](SDLProject/main.cpp).

The triangle's movement has to satisfy the following:
1. It must "orbit" the origin (i.e. the centre of the screen).
2. It must not rotate or scale in any way.
3. It must orbit in a perfectly circular motion. The radius of its orbit is up to you.
4. You must only add code in the designated sections, show in the `main.cpp` file as:

```c++
// ——————————— GLOBAL VARS AND CONSTS FOR TRANSFORMATIONS ——————————— //

// —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— //
```
```c++
// ——————————— YOUR ORBIT TRANSFORMATIONS SHOULD GO HERE ——————————— //
    
// ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— //
```
