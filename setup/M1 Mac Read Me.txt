If you are using an M1 mac, you'll need to change the following settings on the project:

- Open the project in XCode
- Click on the "project" area, it should be called "SDLProject"
- Go to Build Settings -> (All) -> Exclude Architecture -> Debug
- hit the + sign then type arm64 and hit return
- Go to Deployment -> Mac Os Deployment Target
- Choose 11.3

You may need to close XCode and open it again.

here is a setup video guide to follow if you have questions.
