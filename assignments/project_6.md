***No late submissions will be accepted***.

### Ground Rules

- It must be something ***other than a Mario-styled platformer***. If you're going to have gravity-based mechanics (i.e. things falling, etc.), make sure to make your ideas original!
- No [**flappy bird**](https://youtu.be/fQoJZuBwrkU) games or [**doodle jump**](https://youtu.be/wjofzwaC_Oo)-style.
- Top down ([**Legend of Zelda**](https://youtu.be/UQlP9sHf5Ho?t=1473)-style) is totally ok.
- [**Shoot-em-up**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_'em_up) style (vertical or horizontal) is ok, but it must have bullets/projectiles.
- Any of the requirements listed below may be replaced by another feature of your choosing _as long as it is approved by Prof. Romero Cruz_.

### You must use new assets (art, music, and sound) for this project!

You can use the fontsheet, but other than that, you can not use anything from the lectures, even if you have not used them on previous projects. I.e. no `sophie.png`, `george_0.png`, `tileset.png`, and none of the music or sound effects, etc. You _must_ find new assets.

There are some great sources for free assets:
- More by the same [**artist**](https://kenney.nl/assets).
- [**itch.io**](https://itch.io/game-assets/free) has tons of awesome free graphics.
- Lots of different kinds of [**free assets**](https://opengameart.org/).
- Royalty free [**music**](https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html).

#### _Tips_

1. [**Common Issues**](#common-issues)
2. [**Extra Credit**](#extra-credit)

### Requirement 1: _Menu Screen (10%)_

- Show the name of your game and the text `"Press enter to start"` (or any variation thereof). The keycode for enter is: `SDLK_RETURN`
- This can be a solid color background with text on it.
- The menu must be a different `Scene` object. Do not just show/hide text.

### Requirement 2: _2 Minutes of Gameplay (40%)_

- Must have 2 minutes worth of **significant** gameplay.
- Must have 3 levels ([**`Scene`**](https://github.com/sebastianromerocruz/CS3113-material/tree/main/lectures/scenes)).
- You must have some sort of screen scrolling.

### Requirement 3: _Moving AI (20%)_

- There should be at least three of these. They can all look and behave the same way.
- They must move around in some way.

### Requirement 4: _Players Can Win and Lose (10%)_

- Some way for the player to lose (touching an AI, falling off a ledge, running out of time, etc.)
- Some way for the player to win (defeating all AI, collecting all the coins, etc.)

### Requirement 5: _Shader Logic (10%)_

- Use at least one logic-based (i.e. `if`-statements) [**shader**](https://github.com/sebastianromerocruz/CS3113-material/tree/main/lectures/shaders) effect.

### Requirement 6: _Audio (10%)_

- You must have at least 1 looping background music.
- There must be at least _3_ sound effects (walking, player being defeated, shooting, etc.)

---

### _Common Issues_

More planning = less coding. Work out your levels and ideas on paper as well as what classes, objects, textures, and audio youâ€™ll need before you start coding.

For the love of all that is holy and numinous, ***do not procrastinate***.

### _Extra Credit_

- Apply at least one [**special effect**](https://github.com/sebastianromerocruz/CS3113-material/tree/main/lectures/fx). This can be one of the ones we wrote in class or a new one of your making.

### Penalties

- **-10pts**: Did not submit [**final project proposal**](https://forms.gle/nnThNUHVudJXbK6c8) by 08/01/24.
- **-10pts**: Did not attend play-testing sessions on 08/01/24 and 08/13/24.
