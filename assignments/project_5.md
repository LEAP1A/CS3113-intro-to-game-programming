## Submission instructions

1. You _must_ use delta time, the `Entity`, `Map`, and `Scene` classes, and fixed time steps in this assignment.
2. You must have pushed your homework on **Github** _and_ have it ready to present by the start of class time.
3. Do not use any OpenGL functionality that we have not learned in class (unless I have approved its use).
4. Your `main.cpp` file should contain a header comment block as follows:

```c++
/**
* Author: [Your name here]
* Assignment: [Your game's name here]
* Date due: [Your presentation date], 2:00pm
* I pledge that I have completed this assignment without
* collaborating with anyone else, in conformance with the
* NYU School of Engineering Policies and Procedures on
* Academic Misconduct.
**/
```

***No late submissions will be accepted***.

## Ground Rules

- It must be something ***other than a Mario-styled platformer***. If you're going to have gravity-based mechanics (i.e. things falling, etc.), make sure to make your ideas original! If you make a platformer for your final project, you will receive an automatic 25% penalty.
- No [**flappy bird**](https://youtu.be/fQoJZuBwrkU) games or [**doodle jump**](https://youtu.be/wjofzwaC_Oo)-style.
- Top down ([**Legend of Zelda**](https://youtu.be/UQlP9sHf5Ho?t=1473)-style) is totally ok.
- [**Shoot-em-up**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_'em_up) style (vertical or horizontal) is ok, but it must have bullets/projectiles.
- Any of the requirements listed below may be replaced by another feature of your choosing _as long as it is approved by Prof. Romero Cruz_.
- If you present on the first available presentation date (April 25th), you will receive 10 extra points for this project. In other words, you can get an 110% if you complete all of the requirements.

## You must use new assets (art, music, and sound) for this project!

You can use the fontsheet, but other than that, you can not use anything from the lectures _nor from your previous projects. I.e. no `sophie.png`, `george_0.png`, `tileset.png`, and none of the music or sound effects, etc. You _must_ find new assets.

There are some great sources for free assets:
- More by the same [**artist**](https://kenney.nl/assets).
- [**itch.io**](https://itch.io/game-assets/free) has tons of awesome free graphics.
- Lots of different kinds of [**free assets**](https://opengameart.org/).
- Royalty free [**music**](https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html).

## Requirement 1: _Menu Screen (10%)_

- Show the name of your game and the text `"Press enter to start"` (or any variation thereof). The keycode for enter is: `SDLK_RETURN`
- This can be a solid color background with text on it.
- The menu must be a different `Scene` object. Do not just show/hide text.

<a id="2"></a>

## Requirement 2: _2 Minutes of Gameplay (40%)_

- Must have 2 minutes worth of **significant** gameplay. This does not mean _exactly_ 2 minutes, but rather that the game can go on for 2+ minutes.
- Must have 3 levels ([**`Scene`**](https://github.com/sebastianromerocruz/CS3113-material/tree/main/lectures/scenes)).

If your idea doesn't revolve around multi-level-based design, whatever scene structure that you implement _must_ contain around the same quantity of content as a 3-level game.

<a id="3"></a>

## Requirement 3: _Moving AI (20%)_

- There should be at least three distinct types of these.
- They must transform in some way.

These don't necessarily need to be enemies! Homing projectiles, moving platforms/obstacles also count as long as they are distinct from each other in behaviour.

<a id="4"></a>

## Requirement 4: _Players Can Win and Lose (10%)_

- Some way for the player to lose (touching an AI, falling off a ledge, running out of time, etc.)
- Some way for the player to win (defeating all AI, collecting all the coins, etc.)

Note that past students have done games where there are no win/lose conditions (e.g. a farming sim, etc.). This is also fine, but you _must_ let us know in advance.

<a id="5"></a>

## Requirement 5: _Shader Logic (10%)_

- Use at least one logic-based (i.e. `if`-statements) [**shader**](https://github.com/sebastianromerocruz/CS3113-material/tree/main/lectures/shaders) effect.
- It can be any of the ones we talked about in class (or of your own design), but it _must_ contribute the overall theme and experience of your game (i.e. don't just make the screen red for the sake of it).

<a id="6"></a>

## Requirement 6: _Audio (10%)_

- You must have at least 1 looping background music.
- There must be at least _3_ sound effects (walking, player being defeated, shooting, etc.)

## _Common Issues_

More planning = less coding. Work out your levels and ideas on paper as well as what classes, objects, textures, and audio youâ€™ll need before you start coding.

For the love of all that is holy and numinous, ***do not procrastinate***.

## _Extra Credit_

- Apply at least one [**special effect**](https://github.com/sebastianromerocruz/CS3113-material/tree/main/lectures/fx). This can be one of the ones we wrote in class or a new one of your making.

## _Penalties_

- **-10pts**: Did not submit [**final project proposal**](https://forms.gle/nnThNUHVudJXbK6c8) by Monday, April 7th, at 11:59pm.
- **-10pts** (per session): Did not attend play-testing sessions on April 11th _and_ April 18th.
