### Part 1: _What Playtesting Is_

Playtesting is a crucial stage in the development of a video game, as it allows developers to gather feedback and identify any issues or bugs that need to be addressed before the game is released to the public. The playtesting process typically involves several steps:

1. **Planning**: The first step in the playtesting process is to create a plan outlining the goals of the playtest, the target audience, the methods that will be used to collect feedback, and the timeline for the playtest.

2. **Recruiting**: Next, developers need to recruit playtesters who represent the intended audience for the game. This can include both experienced gamers as well as new players who may provide valuable insights into the game's accessibility and ease of use.

3. **Conducting the playtest**: During the playtest, participants are given a prototype or beta version of the game to play for a set amount of time. They are often asked to complete specific tasks or scenarios while playing, and their gameplay sessions may be recorded for later analysis.

4. **Collecting feedback**: After the playtest, developers gather feedback from the participants through surveys, interviews, focus groups, and other methods. This feedback can help identify areas where the game excels, as well as areas that need improvement.

5. **Analyzing results**: Once the feedback has been collected, developers analyze the data to identify common trends, issues, and suggestions for improvement. This information is then used to make changes to the game before its release.

6. **Iterative testing**: Playtesting is often an iterative process, with multiple rounds of testing conducted throughout the development cycle. This allows developers to address issues as they arise and ensure that the game is as polished as possible before launch. As they say:

    > _"Oh, you're 90% done? Let me know when the other 90% done is finished."_

Playtesting is essential for ensuring that a video game is engaging, enjoyable, and free of major bugs or issues. By gathering feedback from real players, developers can make informed decisions about how to improve their game and create a better overall experience for players.

### Part 2: _What Playtesting Isn't_

The key thing to remember about playtesting and video game testing are _not_ the same thing. While both playtesting/playtesters and video game testing serve important roles in the game development process, they differ in their focus, timing, and goals. Playtesting is more about improving the overall player experience and game design, while video game testing is focused on ensuring technical quality and readiness for release.

Here are some key differences between playtesting/playtesters and video game testers:

1. **Purpose**: Playtesting is typically done during the development process of a game, with the aim of providing feedback to developers on the overall player experience and game design. Video game testing, on the other hand, is typically done closer to the game's release to identify and report bugs and glitches.

2. **Scope**: Playtesting often involves a wider range of gameplay aspects, such as level design, mechanics, balancing, and overall player engagement. Video game testing, on the other hand, focuses more on technical aspects like functionality, performance, and stability.

3. **Skills**: Playtesters are usually selected based on their ability to provide detailed feedback on gameplay experiences and offer suggestions for improvement. Video game testers, on the other hand, are typically hired for their technical expertise in identifying and documenting bugs and glitches.

4. **Timing**: Playtesting can occur at various stages of a game's development, from early prototypes to near-final builds. Video game testing usually occurs closer to a game's completion, with the goal of ensuring the game is ready for release.

5. **Feedback**: Playtesters often provide qualitative feedback on their overall experience with the game, highlighting what they enjoyed, what they found frustrating, and what changes they would like to see. Video game testers, on the other hand, focus more on documenting specific technical issues and bugs for developers to fix.

### Part 3: _What Makes For A Good Playtesting Survey?_

In general, the most effective playtesting surveys are those that have a clear goal and keep an open mind. Remember that you are not asking people to playtest for you to boost your ego or to teach them how to play your game. Videogames, as a rule, _should always be accessible to any one who wants to play them_, and if your playtester finds that something in your games gets in the way of that, your goal should be to get as much information about that something as possible with as few questions as possible. Here are some heuristics to follow:

1. **Clearly define the objectives of the playtesting session**: Before creating the survey, it is important to have a clear understanding of what you hope to achieve from the playtesting session. This will help guide the questions you ask and ensure that you are collecting relevant and valuable feedback.

2. **Tailor questions to gather specific feedback**: Create a mix of open-ended and closed-ended questions that are designed to gather specific feedback on different aspects of the game, such as gameplay mechanics, graphics, story, and overall enjoyment.

3. **Keep the survey concise**: Participants are more likely to complete the survey if it is kept short and to the point. Limit the number of questions to only those that are essential for gathering the feedback you need.

4. **Use clear and simple language**: Ensure that the questions are easy to understand and can be answered by participants without confusion. Avoid using technical jargon or complex language that might confuse or alienate participants.

5. **Include a mix of quantitative and qualitative questions**: In addition to asking participants to rate various aspects of the game on a scale, include open-ended questions that allow participants to provide detailed feedback and suggestions for improvement.

6. **Analyze and act on the feedback**: Once the playtesting session is complete, carefully review the survey responses to identify trends and patterns in the feedback. Use this information to make informed decisions about the development of the game and implement any necessary changes based on the feedback received.

- **Effective, productive game playtesting questions**:

    1. How challenging did you find the game overall, and what mechanics added to that difficulty level, in your opinion?
    2. Were the game instructions clear and easy to understand? If not, what would you have liked to have seen elaborated more clearly?
    3. What was your experience between levels? What kind of gameplay changes did you notice between then?
    4. Did you feel engaged and entertained while playing the game? Why / Why not?
    5. How would you rate the game's graphics and sound effects in terms of how much they added to the experience of the game?

- **Ineffective, not productive game playtesting questions**:

    1. Did you like the game?
    2. Was the game too hard or too easy for you?
    3. Would you recommend this game to a friend?
    4. What should I fix to make the game more fun?
    5. Did you find any parts of the game boring or uninteresting?
